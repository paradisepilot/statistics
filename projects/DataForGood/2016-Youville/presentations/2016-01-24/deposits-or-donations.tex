\begin{itemize}
\item	Thanks to the great discussion between Hasan and Robert, I was switching my analysis
	between \texttt{DepositItems} and \texttt{DonationReceipts}.

\vskip 0.5cm
\item	I will refrain from making any conclusions at this point.

\vskip 0.5cm
\item	Please consider the following slides as exploratory and comparative analysis of
	the Youville Centre data, in particular, a comparison between the data contents
	of \texttt{DepositItems} and \texttt{DonationReceipts}.

Scatter plot based on rows from the table \texttt{DepositItems} with {\color{red}\texttt{Amount} $> 0$}
and \texttt{ContactTypeMain} being corporate/small business or registered charity.
The dates are \texttt{DepositDate} obtained from left-joining the tables \texttt{DepositItems} and \texttt{Deposits} by \texttt{DepositNum}.
\texttt{ContactTypeMain} was obtained by first joining \texttt{Contacts} and \texttt{ContactTypeMain}, and then left-joining \texttt{DepositItems}
with the resulting table by \texttt{ContactID}.

appears visible in this plot.

\vskip 0.5cm

\begin{itemize}
\item	Next, we look at plots of cumulative donation grouped by \texttt{ContactTypeMain}.

\vskip 0.5cm
\item	These presumably should give some impression of how much donation Youville Centre has been receiving,
	and whether donations from the various contact types have been slowing down or speeding up.

\vskip 0.5cm
\item	Comparing the plots based on \texttt{DepositItems} against those based on \texttt{DonationReceipts}
	also seems to indicate that the former does contain a lot more ``stuff" than the latter (but, obviously,
	the extra stuff may or may not be relevant to the data analysis requested by Youville).

\textbf{\color{red}Warning:}\;\;
Many rows in the table \texttt{DepositItems} have negative values under \texttt{Amount}.
The plot above is based on rows in the \texttt{DepositItems} with \texttt{Amount} $> 0$.
In other words, I am tacitly assuming that all rows with \texttt{Amount} $>0$ correspond to donations, and all
rows with negative values under \texttt{Amount} are non-donations.
Please let me know if I am mistaken, or perhaps we could verify with clients.

Cumulative donation plot based on \texttt{DonationReceipts}.
Notable differences from \texttt{DepositItems} counterparts:
\begin{itemize}
\item	significantly reduced vertical scale
\item	minute contribution of Government (among donation receipts)
\item	plateauing of Charity, Foundation and Government roughly after 2003
\item	presence of a small group of donations (pink line, labeled "Unmatched ContactID") apparently not
	captured in \texttt{DepositItems} (note the dates).
	The vast majority of the \texttt{ContactID}'s of these rows on the \texttt{DonationReceipts} table are missing;
	those of the small remaining minority do NOT appear on the \texttt{Contacts} table.

I guess this is a moot question by now, right? But since I have generated the plot already, let's have a look anyway:
The above plot shows that \texttt{DepositDate} and \texttt{DonationReceiptDate} are very similar
for those rows on \texttt{DepositItems} for which both dates are deducible (by joining tables).
The large rectanglar patch corresponds to rows on \texttt{DepositItems} whose \texttt{DonationReceiptDate}'s
are NOT deducible, and random dates were generated for them for visualization purposes.
\textit{Mini-conclusion: if we had to use \texttt{DepositItems} after all, using the \texttt{DepositDate} from \texttt{Deposits}
is probably simpler and more reliable than imputing dates based on data from \texttt{DonationReceipts}.}

Each point corresponds to a unique \texttt{ContactID} on \texttt{DonationReceipts} and
shows the first donation receipt date against the most recently receipt date of that \texttt{ContactID}.
Colouring is based on \texttt{ContactTypeMain} while the bubble size indicates (not too reliably)
the total amount of donation of that \texttt{ContactID} over time.
All points should show appear on or above the straight line of slope one.
Those points now appearing below that line are the one-time donors with fake (random)
most-recent donation dates for easy visualization
(so, without tinkering, they would have lied perfectly on the slope-one line).
