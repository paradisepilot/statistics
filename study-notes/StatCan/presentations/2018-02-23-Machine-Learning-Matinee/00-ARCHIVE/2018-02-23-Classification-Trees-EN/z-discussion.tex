\begin{itemize}\scriptsize
\item
	Possible ML techniques to showcase in demo pipelines:
	\begin{itemize}\tiny
	\item
		Classification: support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, nearest neighbour, neural networks
	\item
		Regression: support vector machines, random forests, regularized regression
	\item
		Unsupervised learning: clustering, PCA, dimension reduction, etc.
	\end{itemize}

\item
	Contents of demo pipelines:
	\begin{itemize}\tiny
	\item
		Master program (philosophy: one ``click'' makes all)
	\item
		README file: how to run the master program, refer user to blog post on Confluence page for associated blog.
	\item
		Documentation in code
	\item
		Optional: PDF version of associated blog post to explain the ML technique of the demo pipeline
	\end{itemize}

\item
	Outreach activities
	\begin{itemize}\tiny
	\item
		Publish blog posts on Confluence page about demo pipelines.
	\item
		Share demo pipelines as ZIP files through the associated blog posts.
	\item
		Give branch-level seminars -- probably a series of two back-to-back seminars
	\item
		Optional: use {\color{red}Jupyter} Notebook to give a live demo during seminars
	\item
		Optional: share demo pipelines through StatCan's (Team Foundation Service) Git repository on Network A.
	\end{itemize}

\item
	Proposed timeframe (subject to adjustment):
	\begin{itemize}\tiny
	\item
		Demo pipeline (choose ML technique, learn the technique, choose language, build demo pipeline):
	\item
		Blog posts:
	\item
		Seminars: \textbf{\color{red}Early February, 2018}
	\end{itemize}

\item
	Keywords:
	\begin{itemize}\tiny
	\item
		bagging, boosting, ensemble methods, deep learning
	\item
		sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, confusion matrix, ROC Curve
	\end{itemize}
