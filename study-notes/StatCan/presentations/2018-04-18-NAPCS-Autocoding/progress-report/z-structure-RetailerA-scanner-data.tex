The structure (not the full data set) of the Retailer A scanner data can be
viewed on the sheet ``Retailer A'' of the spreadsheet cited in the
Supplementary Material section.
More concretely,
\begin{itemize}
\item
	Retailer A's internal product category code (variable $Y$ in this report)
	is found under Column M (with pastel orange background).
\item
	The five product category description features (variables $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{5}$
	in this report) are found under Columns O through S (pastel blue background).
	Note also that these are very short character strings giving categorical
	descriptions of the products. 
\item
	Three additional features were used for model training, found under
	Columns B, C and J.
	Columns B and C (pastel green background) are the product-specific
	textual descriptions.
\end{itemize}
We stress here immediately that only Columns B and C have counterparts in
Retailer B's scanner data.
