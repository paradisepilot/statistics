The structure (not the full data set) of the concordance table from
Retailer A's internal product category code (variable $Y$ in this report) to NAPCS code
can be viewed on the sheet ``concordance'' of the spreadsheet cited in the
Supplementary Material section.
More concretely,
\begin{itemize}
\item
	Retailer A's internal product category code (variable $Y$ in this report)
	is found under Column A (pastel orange background).
\item
	The NAPCS code corresponding to each given value of Retailer A's
	internal product category code is found under
	Column C (pastel red background). 
\end{itemize}
The training and testing data sets are essentially created by left-joining
Retailer A' scanner data and its concordance table,
using its internal product category code as key, and then splitting the resulting
merged table roughly into two halves.
