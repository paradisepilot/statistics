 abstract = {Donor imputation is frequently used in surveys. However, very few variance estimation methods that take into account donor imputation have been developed in the literature. This is particularly true for surveys with high sampling fractions using nearest donor imputation, often called nearest-neighbour imputation. In this paper, the authors develop a variance estimator for donor imputation based on the assumption that the imputed estimator of a domain total is approximately unbiased under an imputation model; that is, a model for the variable requiring imputation. Their variance estimator is valid, irrespective of the magnitude of the sampling fractions and the complexity of the donor imputation method, provided that the imputation model mean and variance are accurately estimated. They evaluate its performance in a simulation study and show that nonparametric estimation of the model mean and variance via smoothing splines brings robustness with respect to imputation model misspecifications. They also apply their variance estimator to real survey data when nearest-neighbour imputation has been used to fill in the missing values. L'imputation par donneur est souvent utilisée lors d'enquêtes. Cependant, très peu de méthodes d'estimation de la variance, prenant compte de l'imputation par donneur, se trouvent dans la littérature. Ceci est particulièrement vrai pour les enquêtes ayant un taux d'échantillonnage élevé et utilisant l'imputation par le plus proche voisin. Dans cet article, les auteurs développent un estimateur de la variance pour l'imputation par donneur basé sur l'hypothèse que l'estimateur imputé du total de domaine est approximativement sans biais sous le modèle d'imputation, c'est-à-dire le modèle utilisé pour la variable imputée. Leur estimateur de la variance est valide, quels que soient l'ordre de grandeur des taux d'échantillonnage et de la complexité de la méthode d'imputation par donneur, pourvu que la moyenne et la variance du modèle d'imputation puissent être estimées avec une grande précision. Ils évaluent sa performance par une étude de simulation et ils montrent que l'estimation non paramétrique, avec des splines de lissage, de la moyenne et de la variance du modèle, est robuste même si le modèle d'imputation est mal spécifié. Ils appliquent aussi leur estimateur de la variance à de vraies données d'enquête où la méthode d'imputation par le plus proche voisin est utilisée pour remplacer les valeurs manquantes.},

abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of “good practice” recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the “reference classification” will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process.}

Monte Carlo techniques were used to compare two statistical methods that correct or calibrate remotely sensed areal estimates for misclassification bias using reference data from an error matrix. The inverse calibration estimator was consistently superior to the classical estimator using a simple random sample of reference plots. The effects of sample size of reference plots, detail of the classification system, and classification accuracy on the precision of the inverse estimator are discussed. If reference plots are a simple random sample of the study area, then a total sample size of 500–1000 independent reference plots is recommended for calibration.}

abstract = {A map of land cover or land-cover change produced from remotely sensed data is linked to estimation of area of land cover or land-cover change via an accuracy assessment of the map. A variety of area estimators have been proposed based on different approaches to using the estimated error matrix produced from an accuracy assessment along with information available from the map. These estimators include a stratified estimator (where the strata are the map classes), several model-assisted estimators incorporating the map information as auxiliary variables in a variety of different models, and a bias-adjusted estimator that corrects for classification error when area is computed directly from the map. In some cases the same area estimator results from more than one approach. For stratified random sampling with the map classes defining the strata, the model-assisted and bias-adjusted estimators are equivalent to the stratified estimator of area that would typically be used with this sampling design. Thus the commonly used stratified estimator is the lone choice for stratified random sampling. For simple random sampling, the bias-adjusted estimator and a model-assisted difference estimator are equivalent, but other model-assisted options include poststratified (i.e., applying a stratified estimator to data obtained from a simple random sample), ratio, and simple regression estimators. A simulation study demonstrates that for simple random sampling, the poststratified estimator almost always has the smallest variance among these estimators. The only exception to the superior performance of the poststratified estimator occurred when overall accuracy was very high, the true proportion of area was small (i.e., less than 2%), and the accuracy assessment sample size was small (n=100). Because the poststratified estimator for simple random sampling is equivalent to the stratified estimator used with stratified random sampling, the stratified estimator provides a unified, simple approach to area estimation for these two commonly used sampling designs.}
