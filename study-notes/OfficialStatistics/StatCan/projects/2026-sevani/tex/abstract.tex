\textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
In these notes, we seek to present an exposition of
the framework of SEVANI
(System for the Estimation of Variance due to Nonresponse and Imputation) \cite{Beaumont2011},
developed by Statistics Canada.
More precisely, we state the operational objective and probabilistic assumptions of SEVANI.
We then present the underlying theory of SEVANI as a series of lemmas and propositions.
