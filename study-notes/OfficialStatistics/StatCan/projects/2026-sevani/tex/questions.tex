\begin{itemize}
\item
    True or False: The input data for SEVANI are primarily the output data from Banff and G-Est (Yoho).

    In particular, is it true that SEVANI does NOT deal with unit non-response?
\item
    If the calibration and/or (unit?) non-response adjustments have been applied (to the sampling weights),
